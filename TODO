        > dat[, .(oh08, nchar(oh08))][, .N, V2]
              V2        N
           <int>    <int>
        1:    46 15588858
        2:    NA   115600
        3:    44    10944
        4:    45        1
        5:    64        1
        6:    54        1
        7:    57        1
  ¿Why?

- ¿Do I trust the OCLC numbers?

- Add vagrantfile to set up an environment with everything needed to run this?

- getting lccall from other places would be nice

- LINE 92 of ./2-join-them/join-full.R...
  We can have the other institutions!!!
